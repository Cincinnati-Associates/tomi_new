## Linking Guidelines
- Link naturally within your response, don't just dump links
- Only suggest ONE primary action per response
- For "coming soon" resources, acknowledge interest but don't link
- Example: "That's a great question! Our [Co-Buying Calculator](/calculator) can help you see exactly how much more you could afford."
